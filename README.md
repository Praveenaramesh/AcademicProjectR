Climate change is a significant global challenge of our generation. Its effects on the economy, society, and environment are extensive. Globally, climate change is already having a significant detrimental impact on people's health, and these effects will only deteriorate over time. Due to its geographic location and big population, India is one of the countries that is most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. In India, the anticipated shifts in temperature, precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events like heatwaves, droughts, and floods might all have a detrimental effect on people's health and life expectancy.

This dissertation aims to predict the effect of climate change on life expectancy in India using machine learning techniques. In-depth information on India's life expectancy and climate change will be gathered and pre-processed for the study from a variety of sources. Data on temperature, precipitation, air quality, and other pertinent environmental aspects will be gathered, together with information on demographics and health. By testing and training, machine learning models will be developed and assessed using the proper assessment metrics. Tabulations of final model results will be used to visualise the model's outputs so that inferences may be formed from them.

The study's projections can aid decision-makers in developing effective adaptation and mitigation plans to deal with anticipated effects of climate change on human health and life expectancy in India. The goals of the study include a review of the literature on how climate change affects human health and life expectancy, data gathering from dependable sources, and model training using machine learning techniques like regression and classification. By analysing the data gathered, the study will look into the relationship between climate change and life expectancy in India. This will help policymakers and healthcare experts decide how best to allocate resources and carry out focused interventions.

This dissertation applied machine learning approaches to estimate how climate change would affect India's life expectancy. In-depth data on India's life expectancy and climate change were gathered and pre-processed from a variety of sources for the study. Machine learning models were developed and evaluated, and the results were displayed in the form of tabulation with the highest of 98.58% from the final model by tuning. The study's projections aided in the development of targeted interventions for the populations that were most at risk from the effects of climate change on life expectancy, which lessened the adverse consequences of climate change on human health in India.
